              we did a small group study in Janikaa's home.The day before our meeting you texted me and informed about the group study.
              Honestly at that time I never had any interest to do a group study I accepted only because the person who is asking for 
              study is a girl🤣🤣. I still remember Janikaa picked up me in her scooty and you were waiting in thiruvalluvar nagar bus
              stop. I think that day you were undergoing fasting to express your thanks to lord muruga because of getting admission in
              bharathiar University.

              was a practical, after finishing we went to usha kriti lal hall and had watched culturals. I think during that day in practical you
              were playing truth or dare with our friends,which I didn't participate so you asked me some you played truth or dare with me while 
              walking. after watching culturals we went to have snacks in EB stop tea shop where we ate masala bonda.Then we reached college and 
              janikaa went home and our boys arrived you joined with them. That day you didn't find bus you walked to your hostel with your hostel mate
              ,because you didn't had dinner your mom ordered mutton briyani for your dinner.
