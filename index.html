              we did a small group study in Janikaa's home.The day before our meeting you texted me and informed about the group study.
              Honestly at that time I never had any interest to do a group study I accepted only because the person who is asking for 
              study is a girlðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. I still remember Janikaa picked up me in her scooty and you were waiting in thiruvalluvar nagar bus
              stop. I think that day you were undergoing fasting for lord muruga because of getting admission in
              bharathiar University.

              we had practicals, after finishing we went to usha kriti lal hall and watched culturals. I think that day in our practicals you
              were playing truth or dare with our friends,which I didn't participate so you played truth or dare with me while 
              walking. after watching culturals we went to have snacks in EB stop tea shop there we ate masala bonda.Then we reached college and 
              janikaa went home and our boys arrived you joined with them. That day you didn't get bus you walked to the hostel with your hostel mate
              ,because you didn't had briyani in the party your mom ordered mutton briyani for your dinner(if I am not wrong).
